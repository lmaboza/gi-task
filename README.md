# gi-task
This repository contains a simple practical exercise demonstrating the basic use of Git for version control.
The task includes:

Initializing a Git repository.

Creating and modifying a Python file (hello_world.py).

Using common Git commands: git init, git add, git commit, git status, and git log.

Tracking file changes and understanding staging vs committed states.

Capturing a Git log screenshot to show commit history.

This is part of foundational Git training to understand local repository workflows and source code versioning.
